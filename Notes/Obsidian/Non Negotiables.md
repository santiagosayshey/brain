Inspired by The Bear season 3, I've decided to set some 'non negotiables' for note taking in this vault, i.e. things that must be followed without fail. They are as follows:

| Non Negotiable                                         | Description                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| All notes must be readable in both light AND dark mode | Images, text, functions, etc must be viewable and readable in light and dark mode, so that I can edit them in dark mode, and print them off in light mode.  |
